What do you mean, 'Yes'? I know it’s not alright.<br>
You did what you had to do, and you deserve better than this.<br>
It's okay to admit you're not feeling well; I won’t judge you.<br>
Please know that I will always be proud of you, no matter what.<br>
I see your efforts and hard work.<br>
Don’t think I’m just saying this to cheer you up—I truly mean it.<br>
What you did was hard and very tiring, and you accomplished it all.<br>
It’s not your fault you received that grade; what you did was enough, okay?<br>
Please don’t blame yourself.<br>
You can still make up for it.<br>
Makukuha pa natin yan medal na yan, and magiging proud pa yung parents natin pagdating ng moving up—don’t give up!<br><br>

Don’t worry; Eu is not as disappointed as you think she is.<br>
She sees your efforts and hard work.<br>
She’s actually more proud of you for doing your best than disappointed about the grade you received.<br>
You can still make up for it.<br>
She knows you’re worried about your grades because you might not be able to go up on stage to receive your medal,<br>
but just trust in God; you’ll make it.<br>
You can do this!<br><br>

I hope this makes your night better.<br>
Don’t think too much; you’re doing great.<br>
Come to her when you need her, okay?<br>
She loves you so much and cares about you.<br>
You can always be vulnerable around her; she won’t invalidate your feelings or make you feel like you’re being too sensitive.<br><br>

That’s all.<br>
Good night! Please sleep well, and don’t forget to pray!<br><br>

Sending warm hugs,<br>
-Eu's Bear</font>
