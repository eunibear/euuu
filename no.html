                <font size="4">Finally, you admit that you're not okay.<br>
You don't have to hide how you feel; you can tell Eu if you're sad.<br>
She'll be there for you if you need someone to listen and talk to.<br>
Eu and I hope you don't blame yourself for the low grade you received.<br>
We all know that what you did was hard and very tiring, and it's not your fault.<br><br>

Don't worry; Eu is not as disappointed as you think she is.<br>
She sees your efforts and hard work.<br>
She's actually more proud of you for doing your best than disappointed about the grade you received.<br>
You can still make up for it.<br>
She knows you're worried about your grades because you might not be able to go up on stage to receive your medal,<br>
but just trust in God; you'll make it.<br>
You can do this!<br><br>

I hope this makes your night better.<br>
Don’t think too much; you’re doing great.<br>
Come to her when you need her, okay?<br>
She loves you so much and cares about you.<br>
You can always be vulnerable around her; she won’t invalidate your feelings or make you feel like you’re being too sensitive.<br><br>

That’s all.<br>
Good night! Please sleep well, and don’t forget to pray!<br><br>

Sending warm hugs,<br>
-Eu's Bear</font>
